Upon cloning the project from github, the executable files will have
wrong permisions and an error message will be displayed:

Could not display "tcp_socket_linux_64bit".
There is no application installed for "executable" files.
Do you want to search for an application to open this file?

To fix this, open a terminal and issue the command:
sudo chmod +x tcp_socket_linux_64bit

to make the binary executable.
